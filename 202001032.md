**Explaining the errors**

1) **Type: [import]**

As seen in the code at lines 11,13,14 and 16 there are libraries of torch, torch.nn.functional, torch.nn.utils and tqdm which have not been installed yet.  


2) **Type: [return value]**

In line 36, the function definition defines that the function “generate” will return a list of string values. Also in line 57, a variable “decoded” is initialized as an empty list with initial values as “None” and size of variable bsz. I.e. the length of prompts.

But as it can be seen that later on in the function while returning the value, in line 110 and 116, the list decoded is returned which may not be storing all string values at each place. Thus we are getting a return-value error.

3) **Type: [assignment]**

In line 50, the function definition defines a variable called file of type list. But at line 76, the file is assigned a value of None, which is incompatible.

4) **Type: [call-overload]**

While setting value of decoded when the value of d is None, there is an error in assigning the value to variable decoded.

5) **Type: [name-defined]**

The variable prompt_tokens_len is never used again in the code and is redundant.
